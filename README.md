# 🏥 AI-Driven Transcription and Analysis for Medical Conversations

## 📖 Overview

This repository focuses on leveraging **AI-driven transcription and analysis** to enhance healthcare workflows. By transcribing and analyzing doctor-patient conversations, the system integrates valuable insights into **Electronic Health Records (EHR)**, improving documentation accuracy, reducing administrative burdens, and boosting patient outcomes.

Our solution employs advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **multimodal approach** to provide a holistic analysis of medical conversations.

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 **Real-time Transcription**: Convert doctor-patient conversations into accurate text.
- 🤖 **Multimodal Analysis**: Combine **textual** and **audio** data for deeper insights:
  - Analyze verbal (speech-to-text) and non-verbal cues (e.g., tone, sentiment).
- 💻 **EHR Integration**: Seamlessly update patient records with enhanced documentation.
- 🔄 **Feedback Loop**: Refine accuracy and usability based on clinician input.
- 🔒 **Data Privacy**: Compliant with healthcare regulations like HIPAA for secure handling of sensitive data.

## 🧠 Multimodal Approach

Our **multimodal system** enhances the analysis by integrating both text and audio data:

1. **Transcribe Conversations**: Accurately convert speech into text.
2. **Detect Non-Verbal Cues**: Analyze tone, sentiment, and rhythm to provide emotional and contextual insights.
3. **Enrich Documentation**: Add verbal and non-verbal analysis to EHRs, offering a comprehensive view of patient interactions.
4. **Support Diagnosis**: Combine speech patterns with contextual analysis for better decision-making.
